## Genki I Lesson 1

Full disclosure as of right now I am on Lesson 5, so I will not be learning alongside the reader but I will share my thoughts as I believe I had them during the progression of the chapter. 

**1.1 XはYです**

    〜です: It is...
    
Ex: じゅうにじはん**です**。（It) is half past twelve.  
Ex: がくせい**です**。(I) am a student.  
Ex: にほんご**です**。(My major) is the japanese language.   

Note that none of these sentences has a 'subject' like in english, in japanese speakers omit subjects when it is clear to the listener what the subject is (through context).

To make things explicit you can use the format:

    ＿＿＿は＿＿＿です。  ->    ＿＿＿is＿＿＿ / As for＿＿＿it is＿＿＿
    
Where the first underlined portion is the thing being talked about, and the second underlined portion is what the former is being identified/described by. 

Ex: やましたさん**は**せんせいです。 Mr. Yamashita is a teacher.  
Ex: メアリーさん**は**アメリカじんです。 Mary is an American.  

Note: は is a particle and as a particle is is pronounced as わ

**1.2 Question Sentences**

To form a question in japanese just add **か** to the end of the statement.

Ex: りゅがくせいです。(I) am an international student   
Ex: りゅがくせいです**か**。(Are you) an international student?  

Question sentences may also need specifying terms such as 何(what), 何時(what time), 何歳(How old), 何年生(what year in school) to give the listener more insight into what you are asking. 

Ex. A: せんこうは**なん**です**か**。 What is your major?    
Ex: B: えいごです。 (My major) is English.
    
Ex: A: いま**なんじ**です**か**。 What time is it now?   
Ex: B: くじです。(It is) Nine o'clock.
    
**1.3 NounのNoun**

    NounのNoun
    Further Restriction の　Main idea

の is used to connect two nouns

Ex:　たけしさん**の**でんわばんごう 　Takeshi's phone number   
Ex:　にほんご**の**がくせい 　Student of the japanese language

Observe the differing order of the location of the japanese and english words in the examples. Japanse seems to be more consistent in arranging ideas, main idea comes at the end with further descriptions being placed before. 

Ex: たけしさん**の**おかあさんはこうこう**の**せんせいです。　Takeshi's mother is a highschool teacher.
