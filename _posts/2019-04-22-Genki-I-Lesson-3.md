## Genki I Lesson 3

Full disclosure as of right now I am on Lesson 5, so I will not be learning alongside the reader but I will share my thoughts as I believe I had them during the progression of the chapter.

**3.1 Verb Conjugation**

In this lesson we learn three forms of verbs:

- Dictionary form
- Present Tense Affirmative Form
- Present Tense Negative Form


There are three kinds of Verbs we learn in this lesson:

- Ru-Verbs
- U-Verbs


Ru-verbs are called so because you add the suffix る to the verb base. For example たべる is たべ＋る. For the two long forms mentioned earlier, you add ます and ません to the base. Creating conjugations such as 食べます and 食べません.

	Verb Base Tabe
    Dictionary Form 食べる
    Present, Affirmative 食べます
    Present, Negative 食べません
    Stem 食べ

U-verbs, act in the same way as Ru-verbs in that they can be broken down into Base and Suffix. For example 行く can be broken down into the base Ik and suffix U. The long forms are then created using the suffixes imasu (います）and imasen（いません). For U-verbs you are shifting the suffix to the left where the U suffix becomes its corresponding I suffix. For example: 行く becomes 行きます and 行きません when conjugated. It follows that for other ending suffixes the same follows む becomes み, and so on.

	Verb Base Ik
    Dictionary Form 行く
    Present, Affirmative 行きます
    Present, Negative　行きません
    Stem 行き

As with most things in language learning there are also irregualar verbs, we will learn two of them now.

	Dictionary Form する
    Present, Affirmative　します
    Present, Negative　しません
    Stem　し

	Dictionary Form くる
    Present, Affirmative　きます
    Present, Negative　来ません
    Stem　き

These irregular verbs also form compound verbs, and as such these compound verbs should conjugate the same as the irregular verbs of which they contain.

Important note for differentiating Ru and U Verbs, Irregular Verbs aside, if you see A, U, O right before the final る they are U-verbs. If you see I or E before the final　る then IN MOST CASES they are Ru-verbs.

**3.3 Particles**

Nouns must usually be follwed by particles, which indicate the relation betweent the noun and the verb. Here we will learn を、で、に、and へ.

- **を** indicates "Direct objects", the kind of things that are directly involved in, or affected by, the event. を is prounced as "o".

Ex: 音楽を聞きます　I listen to music.

- **で** indicates where the event described by the verb takes place.

Ex: 図書館で本を読みます I will read books in the library

- **に** indicates either 1. Goal toward which things move, or 2. Time at which event takes place.

Ex: １．私は今日学校に行きません Tomorrow I will not go to school
Ex: ２.日曜日に京都に行きます On sunday I will go to kyoto

- **へ** indicates the same as に's (1). The Goal toward which things move. They are interchangeable.

Ex: 私は今日学校へ行きません Tomorrow I will not go to school

**3.4 Time reference**

As seen right before this, に is used to indicate time at which event takes place. BUT not just any time!

**ONLY** things that can be described using numbers. For example Sunday is the 7th day of the week, March is the 3rd month, 10:45am.

Things like "tomorrow", "evening", and "when" cannot be "translate" to numbers so に should **NOT** be used.

**3.5 〜ませんか**

You can use ませんか or rather, the present tense negative verb + question particle to extend an invitation.

Ex: 昼ご飯を食べませんか How about lunch with me?
Ex: テニスをしませんか Will you play tennis with me?

**3.7 Frequency Adverbs**

You can add a frequency adverb to a sentence to describe how often you do something. These do not require particles such as に as far as I can tell.

Ex: 私はときどき喫茶店に行きます I sometimes go to a coffee shop.

There is also infrequency adverbs such as ぜんぜん and あまり which anticipate negative sentences, you cannot use a present, affirmative verb with these adverbs, it can only be present, negative verbs.

Ex: 私はぜんぜんテレビ見ません I do not watch TV at all.
Ex: たけしさんはあまり勉強しません Takeshi does not study much.

**Not inlcuding 3.2, 3.6, and 3.8**

They seem pretty self explanatory if you are doing the workbook questions and reading the texbook examples.
