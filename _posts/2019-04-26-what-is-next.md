## What is next? 

See my last post for a brief-ish overview of what's been going on and building up to now. Long story short, school isn't going, great; understatement of the year. But what's next? 

I am taking the summer off, a few weeks ago I thought maybe I would do some traveling but that idea has rapidly left my mind since I had to repay my university for financial aid that was previously granted to me last semester since I did not pass 66.67% of classes that semeseter. That was -$xxxx. Leaving me with a double digit bank balance. And it looks like I will have to do the same with this semester's financial aid also totaling around $2000. So I will be working this summer and probably this fall in order to gather the funds. 

But what then? I don't know if I will be able to return to that university since my gpa is likely to be less that 1.5. What then? And even if I returned do I really think I can succeed this time around? I have been pedaling that thought for the last few semesters, each time thinking that this was going to be the semester I turn it around. 

What next? I truly don't know. I have been brainstorming if I want to change my major, since this passion of mine isn't working out for me. As much as I love engineering, desinging, building, etc. I don't have the aptitude for the learning of it's basics. I have been mulling over different majors. Majors that I know are bad ideas in this job climate. Whether it be history or philosophy or I don't know what. I feel like I am setting myself up for failure. 

Having an actual panic attack while typing this, my vision is going blury, I feel like I am going to throw up, my heart is beating too fast, I am shaking, I feel like the minute i stop typing i will fall to the floor and curl up in the fetal position. I am scared. Its a scary situation I find myself in. Breathe in Breathe out. 

That's it for now. I have to go.
