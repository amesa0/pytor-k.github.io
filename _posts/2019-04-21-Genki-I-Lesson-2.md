## Genki I Lesson 2

Full disclosure as of right now I am on Lesson 5, so I will not be learning alongside the reader but I will share my thoughts as I believe I had them during the progression of the chapter. 

**2.1 これ、それ、あれ、どれ**

    これ : This (Close to speaker)
    それ : That (Close to listener)
    あれ : That over there (Close to neither)
    どれ : Which (Remember to end with か)
    
Ex: これはいくらですか。How much is this?    
Ex: それはさんぜんえんです。That is 3,000 Yen.  
Ex: あれはわたしのぺンです。That is my pen.  
Ex: どれですか。Which one is it (That you are talking about).  

Note that words like どれ and なに（何) cannot be followed by は, and instead need to be followed by が. The exact reasons I know not, but I assume it has to do with the fact that は is a topic particle and　が is a Identifier particle. We will learn more about this later.

**2.2 この／その／あの／どの　＋　Noun**

To be slightly more specific when identifying something you can use この／その／あの／どの　followed directly by a noun. Think back to last lesson's NounのNoun, it is the same concept. Instead of saying "this" and context determining how the listener understands you can specify what you are talking about "this watch".

Ex: これはいくらですか。How much is this?  
Ex: このとけいはいくらですか。 How much is this watch?  

Note that the same follows for どの as it does for　どれ regarding the が　rather than　は.

**2.3 ここ、そこ、あそこ、どこ**

    ここ　 : Here (Close to speaker)
    そこ 　: There (Close to listener)
    あそこ : Over there (Close to neither)
    どこ　 : Where (Remember to end with か)

Ex: すみません。ゆうびんきょくはどこですか。Excuse me. Where is the post office?  
Ex: あそこです。(The post office) is over there.  

**2.4 だれのNoun**

	だれ　 : Who
    だれの : Whose
    
We can use だれのNoun to ask who something belongs to.

Ex: これはだれのかばんですか。 Whose Bag is this?   
Ex: それはスーさんのかばんです。That is Sue's Bag.  

**2.5 Nounも**

Here we introduce the particle も this particle is the inclusive topic particle. In lesson 1 we learned XはYです in order to say X is Y, now we will learn X is Y, and X is Y too. 

	AはYです。　A is Y.
    BもYです。　B is also Y. \ B is Y too. 
    
**2.6 Noun　じゃないです。**

To negate statement of the form XはYです, where Y is a noun, you replace です with じゃないです.
There is also different levels of appropriateness for situations, if you were to think of じゃないです as casual, じゃありません could be considered a more conservative speech style, and even more formal would be ではありません. 

	Affirmative: XはYです。                     X is Y
    
	                    じゃないです。          X is not Y  (Casual)
    Negative:    XはY   じゃありません。        X is not Y  (Conservative)
                        ではありません。        X is not Y  (Formal)
    
**2.7 〜ね/〜よ**

Statements often end with ね or よ to convey certain goals of the Speaker.

ね is often used to seek the listeners confirmation or agreement, think of it as a "right?"  
よ is often used to assure the listener, think of it as an "I'm telling you" or "Believe me"

Ex: これはにくじゃないですね。This isn't meat, right?  
Ex: とんかつはさかなじゃないですよ。 Let me assure you. "Tonkatsu" is not fish.
