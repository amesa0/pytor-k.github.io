### Monday Day 1

Tough, period. Still not over this weird funk I'm in. It's a bit of complacency mixed in with lots of lethargy. I can't complete a workout without yawning, having cold sweats, and nearly falling asleep or passing out. Anyways...

Day 1 started with finding a 10rm, started 60kg, 85kg, 100kg, 110kg and stopped there, I got 120 on my back and despite doing 120kgx10 two weeks ago, I knew I wouldn't be able to today. Then did 100kg for 3x6reps. **I took a 15 minute break since I felt like passing out, not because it was difficult but because it was this weird lethargy and yawning, mid workout during the middle of the day.** Next was close stance squats, 60kg for 3x15reps, easy. Then I did overhand rows 60kg for 3x15reps. Underhand was next but I didn't complete it, I was just too tired. I decided to stop. After dinner I did some more squats, up to 100kg for 3x10reps. I did some more Overhand Barbell rows, 60kg for 3x15reps. Then did snatch grip Romanian Deadlifts, was taking it light and did 60kg for 3x20reps.
